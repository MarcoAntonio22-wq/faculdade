       "\"\\n\\nI am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack\\nof any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,\\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\\nregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!\\n\\n\""
